This is a calculator web app I designed from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JS. 

The calculator can only do four of the basic mathematical operations(addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). I'm also considering adding more functions in the future if time persists. The calculator can also do operations decimal numbers.

The entirety of the project took about 3 consecutive days to finish alotting at most six (6) hours each day. Overall, it was quite fun to play around with functions and certain solutions. I had the most trouble with figuring out how to let the calculator perform operations even without having to click the equal button. (e.g. when you input, say, 2+3-1 the calculator performs 2+3 then subtracts it to 1).

I really enjoyed building this project. This is my own solution to the problem, and I am very aware that many have tried this before but I would love to see others' solutions as well! preferably ways on how to shorten my code. 

Thanks. :)
